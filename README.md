| Google Gemini | gemini-1.5-flash-latest | ‚úÖ         | ![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Active-brightgreen) | Very fast | 8.5/10, very good overall model but requires an API Key. (It's *free*, see the section below) |

### Provider-specific notes
- **Google Gemini**: An API Key is required to use this model. You can get one *completely for free*:
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in to your Google account if you haven't done so.
3. Click on "Create API Key" and follow the instructions there.
4. Copy the API Key and paste it into the corresponding box in the extension preferences.

The rate limit for Google Gemini is 1500 requests per day (as of the time of writing). This should be much more than enough for any normal usage. 
If your use case needs an increased rate limit, you can even create multiple API Keys with different Google accounts; separate them with commas in the preferences.

## Experimental features

### Web Search
Let GPT decide to search the web for information if it does not have enough knowledge or context.

- **How to enable**: Go to the extension preferences and check the "Enable Web Search" box.
- **Setting up**: An API Key is required to use this feature. You can get one *completely for free*:
1. Go to https://app.tavily.com
2. Sign in with a Google/GitHub account.
3. Copy the API Key and paste it into the corresponding box in the extension preferences.

The rate limit for the web search feature is around 500 requests per month (as of the time of writing).
This should be enough for most users, but similarly you can also create multiple API Keys with different accounts; separate them with commas in the preferences.

### Smart Chat Naming
Let GPT automatically come up with a name for the current chat session after you send the first message. For example, this is similar to what the ChatGPT web UI does.
- **How to enable**: Go to the extension preferences and check the "Enable Smart Chat Naming" box.
