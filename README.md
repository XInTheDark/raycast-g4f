# Raycast-G4F (GPT4Free)

Use the powerful GPT-4, Llama-3 and more AI models on Raycast, for FREE - no API Key required.

## Getting Started

### Installation

This extension is currently not available on the Raycast Extension store, but
installation from source is extremely simple.

1. Clone the repository / download source code from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the directory, and open a Terminal window at the downloaded folder.
3. Run `npm ci` to install required dependencies.
4. Run `npm run build` to build the extension.

The extension, and its full set of commands, should then show up in your Raycast app.

#### Troubleshooting
- If `npm run build` doesn't cause the extension to be added to your Raycast app, please try running `npm run dev` instead.
- Also feel free to open an issue if unexpected problems occur.

### Updating

#### Automatically
There is built-in support for updating within the extension itself! Simply run the "Check for Updates" command in the extension,
and it will take care of the update process for you. Furthermore, you can also enable the "Automatically Check for Updates" experimental feature in the preferences.

#### Manually
In the command line, run `git pull`, `npm ci` and `npm run build` (in that order). 

You might want to update manually if the automatic update doesn't work (please also open a GitHub issue if this is the case); 
updating manually also allows you to fetch and view the latest changes to the source code.

| Google Gemini | gemini-1.5-flash-latest | ‚úÖ         | ![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Active-brightgreen) | Very fast | 8.5/10, very good overall model but requires an API Key. (It's *free*, see the section below) |

### Provider-specific notes
- **Google Gemini**: An API Key is required to use this model. You can get one *completely for free*:
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in to your Google account if you haven't done so.
3. Click on "Create API Key" and follow the instructions there.
4. Copy the API Key and paste it into the corresponding box in the extension preferences.

The rate limit for Google Gemini is 1500 requests per day (as of the time of writing). This should be much more than enough for any normal usage. 
If your use case needs an increased rate limit, you can even create multiple API Keys with different Google accounts; separate them with commas in the preferences.

## Experimental features

### Web Search
Let GPT decide to search the web for information if it does not have enough knowledge or context.

- **How to enable**: Go to the extension preferences and check the "Enable Web Search" box.
- **Setting up**: An API Key is required to use this feature. You can get one *completely for free*:
1. Go to https://app.tavily.com
2. Sign in with a Google/GitHub account.
3. Copy the API Key and paste it into the corresponding box in the extension preferences.

The rate limit for the web search feature is around 500 requests per month (as of the time of writing).
This should be enough for most users, but similarly you can also create multiple API Keys with different accounts; separate them with commas in the preferences.

### Smart Chat Naming
Let GPT automatically come up with a name for the current chat session after you send the first message. For example, this is similar to what the ChatGPT web UI does.
- **How to enable**: Go to the extension preferences and check the "Enable Smart Chat Naming" box.

### Automatically Check for Updates (Beta)
Let the extension automatically check for updates every day. If a new version is available, you will be notified,
along with the option to update the extension with a single click.

## FAQs

### Why is this extension not on the official Raycast store?
- I submitted it when the extension was in its early stages, but since Raycast is quite conservative about adding AI extensions, it was rejected because of concerns over the use of third-party APIs. I think this is a valid concern, and I'd like to be very transparent about where your data is going to, so I'll be writing all the details in the project homepage really soon. But do rest assured that I use safe APIs from legitimate websites; I also update the extension very frequently so all the providers I use will be up-to-date.
- Thus, the extension will have to be installed from source. Regarding this, I apologize as it's indeed more complicated than downloading it from the store. I have tried my best to make the installation process quick and streamlined - please do provide feedback on whether it was simple enough!

### How does this extension compare to the paid Raycast AI? 
- First and foremost, raycast-g4f is completely free! I strongly believe that such AI features, especially in an awesome productivity tool like Raycast, shouldn't be locked behind a paywall.
- UI-wise, the biggest difference is probably the chat GUI. Because the developer API that Raycast provides is limited, it's not possible to replicate the Raycast AI interface exactly. The GUI used in my extension is really intuitive however, and it's also used by a lot of AI extensions on raycast.
- Regarding the models available, and the AI quality: Raycast AI definitely has more model options - after all, money talks ;) But please rest assured that the quality of AI responses in my extension is by no means subpar! Some models available are gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4 (authentic!), Google Gemini, as well as large & capable open-source models like Llama3-70B and Mixtral-8x22B. If you still doubt it, I'd encourage you to give the extension a try! :-)
